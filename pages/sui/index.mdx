The Pyth Network Sui contract allows users to submit price updates for verification and store them for later use.
Please see the documentation section on [Pull Updates](documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/on-demand) if you haven't already;
this section will explain the differences between Pyth Network and other oracles, and help you understand the expected usage patterns. Pyth on Sui also automatically pushes prices on-chain for a subset of symbols. More information on this TBA.

Users of the Pyth contract will typically need to perform two operations:

- Update the on-chain price -- In off-chain code, retrieve a verified price update from the
  [price service](documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/price-service) and submit it to the contract
  for verification. This operation makes the price available for on-chain use.
  You will typically call [update_price_feeds](sui/update-price-feeds) to do this.
- Read the on-chain price -- After updating the price, your on-chain contract can call one of the
  many getter functions on the contract to get the price. See [get_price](sui/get-price) and its variants
  for more information.
