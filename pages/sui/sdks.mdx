Sui contracts can program against the Pyth contract's interface by including it as a project dependency.

## Installation Instructions

<Tabs items={['Move']}>
    <Tab>
        First, add the Pyth contract to your project dependencies by adding the following line to the `[dependencies]` section of `Move.toml`:

        ```toml
        [dependencies]
        Pyth = { git = "https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain.git", subdir = "target_chains/sui/contracts", rev = "main" }
        ```

        Note that this dependency references the latest version of the Pyth contract code.
        You can also choose the most recent git sha in order to have a repeatable build.
        This contract was compiled with sui-cli sui 1.0.0-09b208149.

        Next, add the following named addresses to the `[addresses]` section of `Move.toml`:

        ```toml
        [addresses]
        pyth = TBA
        wormhole = TBA
        ```

        These lines allow you to reference Pyth resources as `pyth` instead of manually writing the contract address.
        The contract addresses provided above are for both Sui mainnet -- the Pyth contract has a different address on testnet (contract addresses on Sui are not generated deterministically).

        You can now import the Pyth interfaces in Move code as follows:

        ```rust copy
        use pyth::pyth;
        ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>
