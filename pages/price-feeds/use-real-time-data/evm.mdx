# Pyth on EVM

On-chain EVM programs can use the [Solidity SDK](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity) to read Pyth prices.
The [EVM API reference](../../evm) lets you interactively explore the complete API of the Pyth contract.

The off-chain portion of the application can use [pyth-evm-js](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js) to generate price update transactions. This repository's [Quickstart](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js#quickstart) includes an example of both the on- and off-chain code necessary to integrate with Pyth.
